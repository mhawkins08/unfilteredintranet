# unfilteredintranet
unfilteredintranet also known as UIA is a project that is working to bring a one-time use web-browser to all!

UIA was founded by Mason Hawkins. This project strives to bring ONE-TIME secure internet access to everybody.
The pourpose of this browser is to launch it while on a secure network(VPN) and do what you need to, and close it and never worry again. 
The browser is built on C#, It will automatically delete all logs as soon as the application is exited. 

This project will be updated in the future to become better.
